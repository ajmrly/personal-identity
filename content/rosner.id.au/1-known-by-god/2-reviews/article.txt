>“This work is an exegetical treasure trove full of spiritual encouragements. Its message invites us, even ushers us, into the very intimacy with our faithful God that it proclaims.”

—Craig S. Keener, Ph.D.
F. M. and Ada Thompson Chair of Biblical Studies
 
>“Every last page of Brian Rosner's *Known by God* is filled with careful, convincing exegesis of both testaments of the Christian Bible. But even more striking is how this exegesis is interwoven with the author's disarming self-disclosure, keen pastoral insight, charitable engagement with contemporary literature and culture, and infectious zeal for gospel proclamation. It is that combination that marks this book as a wonderful example of the best of distinctively evangelical biblical theology.”

—Wesley Hill
Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies, Trinity School for Ministry, Ambridge, Pennsylvania.

>“I heard a theologian say in a public meeting that he knew who Jesus was but he did not know who he was. He needed this book by Brian Rosner. Drawing expertly on the biblical witness in conversation with modern angst about human identity, Rosner finds in Scripture the key to answering the identity question. Of particular value in Rosner’s argument is his exploration of the idea of being known by God which is a neglected theme in biblical theology as he rightly points out. Resources found in Dietrich Bonhoeffer and C. S. Lewis also figure helpfully in his account. A book to savor.” 

—Dr. Graham A. Cole
Dean and Vice President of Education
and Professor of Biblical and Systematic Theology
Trinity Evangelical Divinity School

>"Excellent. Theology meant to inform real life. The church would be in much better shape if all theology were like this."

>“Brian Rosner is an Australian Theologian, he’s written a great new book, it just came out this year—so my guess is most of you would not have heard of it—and it’s called *Known by God: A Biblical Theology of Personal Identity*, by Brian Rosner, and it’s the best single book I’ve seen – and it’s very accessible – on all the themes about personal identity in Christ.”

—Tim Keller,  (link: https://gospelinlife.com/downloads/how-a-gospel-identity-grows/ text: Gospel Identity Conference), New York, November 2017

>"What I begin noticing when reading this book is how little I had thought of its subject before, how few books I had ever seen on the subject, and how at a loss I would have been to talk meaningfully about it. Brian Rosner has stepped into the lacuna to explain some theology that’s comforting to know but rarely discussed."

—Jimmy R. Reagan, (link: https://thereaganreview.com/2017/09/17/known-by-god-by-rosner/ text: The Reagan Review).

>"This is one of the most stimulating books I have read this year.  Despite what it is missing it is still worth a read, especially since identity is the key idea we need to engage with right now."
