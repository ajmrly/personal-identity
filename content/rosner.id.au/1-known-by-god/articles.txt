Title: Known by God

----

Text: In 2017 I had the privilege of unleashing my favourite book yet, *Known by God: A Biblical Theology of Personal Identity*, through the wonderful team at Zondervan. This then sparked a broader discussion on identity and in seeking to continue that discussion, we felt it beneficial to create a hub of sorts for related writings on the topic.
