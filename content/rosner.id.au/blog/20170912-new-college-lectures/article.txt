The inaugural New College lectures were delivered in 1987 by Professor Malcolm Jeeves of the University of St Andrews, Scotland. Each New College lecturer is asked to take up some important issue or aspect of contemporary society and to comment on it from the standpoint of their Christian faith and professional expertise. These lectures have become an important public event and have attracted large interest and generated much discussion. In 2017, Brian was kindly asked to give the New College Lecture, which is a great honour and privilege.

Thus, the 2017 New College Lectures consider the thorny issue of personal identity.

###Lecture 1 - Identity Angst: Unstable Foundations

Traditionally, a person’s identity was more predetermined than it is today: where they would live, what they would do, the type of person they would marry, their basic beliefs. In recent years, identity has increasingly become a personal project, enabled by social media to project a person’s chosen image to the outside world. Despite the attractive possibilities that these new opportunities present, many modern factors weigh against a satisfying sense of self: perceptions of personal significance, relationship breakdown, the pace of life itself, multiple careers, consequent social mobility. For increasing numbers of people, modern life has become an environment of identity angst: “being true to yourself” can seem more like a cruel taunt than a piece of realistic advice. 

While exploring commonly-held beliefs that underpin much of modern life, these three lectures consider the Bible’s answers to the most pressing and personal questions of the postmodern world.
